## How To Create A Markdown Document

This guide will lead you through installing a Markdown-compatible editor, creating a file in the chosen markup language, and previewing the formatted version. Markdown is easy to learn, provides flexibility, high readability, and easy syntaxes. 

For Markdown, there are several compatible editors, I have chosen Visual Studio Code as it is a highly configurable code editor with several Markdown extensions.

Follow the below steps to write content using Markdown in Visual Studio Code.

#### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
1. Go to the following [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Click on the **download** button. The download button is in Blue, according to your operating system it would say *Download for Windows or macOS or Linux* ![](). 
3. The installation would take about a minute.
#### Step 2: Install Markdown Exention
